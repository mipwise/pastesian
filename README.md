# The pastesian problem

*Author*: Luiz Suzana  
*Date*: April 2022

Welcome to my first project at the [Mip Go][Mip Go] training program from [Mip Wise][Mip Wise].

We are going to solve the *pastesian* problem, as described below in the Statement section.

## Statement

*Pastesian* is a family-owned pasta factory which is currently
planning production of lasagnas for the next 4 months.

Lasagnas are prepared and immediately frozen for distribution. 
They have some freezers in the factory where they can store
inventory for several weeks before shipping them to the market.

Based on previous years selling, Pastesian expects demand of
200, 350, 150, and 250 lasagnas for months 1, 2, 3, and 4,
respectively, which must be met exactly. 
Currently, Pastesian has only 50 lasagnas in eventory. 

One tricky thing is that labor cost is going to increase over
the next months, because the factory is located in a touristic
city where there are lots of temporary job opportunities
during high season. This translates into a variable production
cost of $ 5.50, $ 7.20, $ 8.80, and $ 10.90 dollars per lasagna for 
months 1, 2, 3, and 4, respectively.

In addition, electricity charges also varies throughout the 
season. As a result, the cost for keeping one lasagna in
inventory from month 1 to 2 is $ 1.30, from month 2 to 3 is
$ 1.95, and from month 3 to 4 is $ 2.20.

How should Pastesian plan its operations for these upcoming 
months assuming that it will end the season with no lasagna
in inventory?
